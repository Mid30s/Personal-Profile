## Description

This is the first web page I build since I started coding. It is a big challenge to me from the beginning. However,I know all things are difficult before they are easy. Last two week, I learn lots of knowledge about HTML and CSS. This profile page is good way to show my study result.

The first problem I have is flexbox layout in CSS. The navigation bar and projects photos are just go randomly in page. One reason is I do not have a good html layout (such as: correct container). Another one is I am not good at flexbox layout. So I spend more than half day to watch zoom recording about flex layout section. And I also reverse engineered the class mini project code. which I have learned how to make a correct flexbox layout and media query.

What I learn most in this challenge is how to plan and design a web page. A logical HTML structure is the most important lesson that I learned. Since when I begin to add css code, half of my time spend on how to fix bugs in HTML structure.  I realized the importance to have a good logical structure. It will save me a lot of time next time. I also practice css that I learn this week,including hover selector and css button style.
